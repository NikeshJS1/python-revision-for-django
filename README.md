# python-revision-for-django
This repo contains the code which I wrote while practicing and revising the python topics and concepts for my 60-day Django learning series.

# Day 1 Folder:
The Day 1 folder contains the code of my first day revision of Python where I revised variables, datatypes and taking inputs from users [input() function].

# Day 2 Folder:
The Day 2 folder contains the code of my second day revision of Python. I revised conditional statements and string operations.
